Now that you have gone over the first **UUID** overview, let's make sure you have learned most the important points.

Here are a set of questions for you to answer.
If you cannot answer any of the following questions, then go re-read the overview, to figure out the answer.

1. How many bits of data is a **UUID**?

2. How many bits of data in a **UUID** is used for the **version**?
3. Which specific bits in a **UUID** are used for the **version**?

4. How many bits of data in a **UUID** is used for the **variant**?
5. Which specific bits in a **UUID** are used for the **variant**?

6. How many bits of the bits in a **UUID** are actually available for the **unique ID** (once you take away the bits used for the **version** and the **variant**)?

7. What is the **version** of each of these **UUID**s?

* `62cc68d6-58ee-969a-ae93-0f2fe1835f3c`
