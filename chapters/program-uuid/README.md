# uuid Program ([UUID Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

You are going to use the `uuid` package you created and use it to create program called `uuid`.

The program will output the **canonical** form of a **UUID** created from your ``uuid.Random()`` function using `fmt.Println()`.

## Git Repository

You will create a new git repository for this called `uuid`

So, for example, if you were on `github.com` and your username was `joeblow`, then you new git respository would be at:
```
https://github.com/jowblow/uuid
