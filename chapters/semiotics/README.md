# Semiotics ([UUID Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

If you are already aware of the jargon used in **semiotics** then, **UUID**s are **semiotic** **symbols** (once they are actually used as a identifier (**ID**) for something).

⚠️ **If that (stuff about _semiotics_) doesn't mean anything to you, then just ignore it, and go to the next chapeter (after this one) and keep on reading.**
