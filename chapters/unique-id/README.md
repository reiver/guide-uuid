# GUID ([UUID Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

A **globally unique identifier** (**GUID**) is an **identifier** (**ID**) that is unique everywhere, and across time!
That is strong property!

If you create a **GUID** today, and I create a **GUID** tomorrow, they will be different.
If someone else creates a **GUID** 100 years from now, it will also be different than both of the **GUID**s we each created.
Etc.

## UUID

**UUID** is a convention for **globally unique identifiers** (**GUID**s).

There are other conventions for creating **globally unique identifiers** (**GUID**s) too, that are _not_ **UUID**s.
(You can even make up your own convention.) 
But in this **guide** we will focus on **UUID**s.


⚠️ Note that I feel that there are better conventions for creating **GUID**s than **UUID**s (for reasons that will hopefully become more obvious as you work through this guide). But nevertheless, you will very likely come across **UUID**s, and it would be to your benefit to understand them.
