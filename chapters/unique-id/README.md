# Unique ID ([UUID Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

A **unique identifier** (**unique ID**) is an **identifier** (**ID**) that is unique across some (implicitly or explicitly defined) domain.

The domain could be just within a single database table within a specific database.

The domain could be the universe of all **IDs** that have ever been created, and will ever be created, across time, and across the unverse!
I.e., —
If you create this type of **ID** today, and I create this type of **ID** tomorrow, they will be different.
If someone else creates this type of **ID** 100 years from now, it will also be different than both of the **ID**s we each created.
Etc.

## UUID

**UUID** is an attempt at creating a set of conventions for creating **unique identifiers** (**ID**s) that are unique globally and perhaps even intra-solar'ly, and at the scale of thousands of years.

There are other conventions **unique identifiers** (**unique ID**s) of this scale too, that are _not_ **UUID**s.
(You can even make up your own convention.) 
But in this **guide** we will focus on **UUID**s.


⚠️ Note that I feel that there are better conventions for creating **unique ID**s (of this scale) than **UUID**s (for reasons that will hopefully become more obvious as you work through this guide). But nevertheless, you will very likely come across **UUID**s, and it would be to your benefit to understand them.
