# Git Repository ([UUID Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

Create a new git repository for this called `go-uuid`

So, for example, if you were on `github.com` and your username was `joeblow`, then you new git respository would be at:
```
https://github.com/jowblow/go-uuid
```
